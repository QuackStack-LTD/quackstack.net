							<h3 className='text-xl font-semibold text-orange-400 mt-6'>What data do we collect?</h3>
							<p className='text-gray-300 leading-relaxed'>
								<strong className='text-orange-400'>Email addresses:</strong> The only personal data we collect from you is your email address. We collect this information when you voluntarily provide it to us, such as when you sign up or
								contact us via email.
							</p>
							<p className='text-gray-300 leading-relaxed'>
								<strong className='text-orange-400'>Cookies - How to manage cookies?</strong> We use third-party cookies like but not limited to Google Analytics, Twitter and YouTube, to collect information about how you interact with our
								website. This information is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally. We use this data to improve our website's performance and user experience. You can manage your cookies preferences at any time through
								your browser settings.
							</p>

							<h3 className='text-xl font-semibold text-orange-400 mt-6'>How do we store your data?</h3>
							<p className='text-gray-300 leading-relaxed'>
								At QuackStack, we understand that data is a critical asset for any business, and keeping it secure is of utmost importance. We take our responsibility to protect your data very seriously, and we use state-of-the-art
								technology to ensure that your information is stored safely and securely.
							</p>
							<p className='text-gray-300 leading-relaxed'>One of the ways we store your data is through the use of secure cloud platforms. Our cloud environment offers a range of features designed to keep your data safe:</p>
							<ul className='list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2 ml-4'>
								<li>
									<strong className='text-orange-400'>Encryption:</strong> We use encryption to ensure that your data is secure both when it's in transit and at rest. We use strong encryption standards, including 256-bit Advanced Encryption
									Standard (AES) encryption, to ensure that your data is always protected.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className='text-orange-400'>Data Segregation:</strong> We make sure that your data is segregated from other customers' data. This means that your data is stored separately and cannot be accessed or tampered with by
									anyone else.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className='text-orange-400'>Multi-Factor Authentication:</strong> We use multi-factor authentication to ensure that only authorised personnel can access your data. This means that we require more than just a
									password to access your data - we also use additional factors, such as biometric information or a token, to verify identity.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className='text-orange-400'>Firewalls:</strong> We use firewalls to protect your data from unauthorised access. Our firewalls act as a barrier between the internet and your data, blocking any attempts to access it
									that do not meet our strict security protocols.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong className='text-orange-400'>Regular Backups:</strong> We regularly back up your data to ensure that it can be restored in the event of a disaster or data loss. Our backups are stored in a separate location,
									ensuring that even if there is a failure in one location, your data will still be safe.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p className='text-gray-300 leading-relaxed'>
								At QuackStack we use the latest technology to ensure that your data is stored safely and securely. By using secure cloud platforms, we can provide a secure environment that gives you peace of mind knowing that your data is
								protected at all times.
							</p>

							<h3 className='text-xl font-semibold text-orange-400 mt-6'>Will your data be shared with anyone?</h3>

								We do not share your personal data with others outside of QuackStack. We do not disclose your personal data to any third parties, except for our trusted service providers who assist us in operating our website and providing
