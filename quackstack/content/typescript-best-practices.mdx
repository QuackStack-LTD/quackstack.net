# TypeScript Best Practices for Scalable Applications

TypeScript has become the standard for building large-scale JavaScript applications. In this guide, we'll explore best practices that will help you write better TypeScript code and build more maintainable applications.

## Type Safety First

Always prioritize type safety in your TypeScript applications:

### Use Strict Mode

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"strict": true,
		"noImplicitAny": true,
		"strictNullChecks": true
	}
}
```

### Define Clear Interfaces

```typescript
interface User {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	email: string;
	role: 'admin' | 'user' | 'moderator';
	createdAt: Date;
}
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Generic Types

```typescript
interface APIResponse<T> {
	data: T;
	status: number;
	message: string;
}

function fetchData<T>(url: string): Promise<APIResponse<T>> {
	// Implementation
}
```

### Utility Types

```typescript
type PartialUser = Partial<User>;
type UserEmail = Pick<User, 'email'>;
type UserWithoutId = Omit<User, 'id'>;
```

## Code Organization

1. **Use barrel exports** for cleaner imports
2. **Organize types** in separate files
3. **Follow naming conventions** consistently
4. **Document complex types** with JSDoc comments

## Conclusion

Following these TypeScript best practices will help you build more robust and maintainable applications. The key is consistency and gradual adoption of advanced patterns as your codebase grows.
