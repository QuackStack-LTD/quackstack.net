# About This Site: QuackStack.net

QuackStack.net is our studio’s marketing site — but we treat it like a product.

It’s designed to be:

- **Fast** (especially on mobile)
- **Clear** (easy to scan, easy to navigate)
- **Maintainable** (easy to add projects and articles)

## What it’s built with

- **Next.js (App Router)** for routing and rendering
- **TypeScript** for safer refactors
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling
- **MDX (via Nextra)** so writing posts feels like plain markdown

## Structure

- A single-page home layout with sections (Services, Projects, Team, etc.)
- Project case-study pages under `/project/[projectId]`
- A blog under `/blog` backed by files in `content/`

## Performance choices

We like motion — but we don’t want it to cost usability.

- Effects are reduced automatically on coarse pointers (touch), small screens, and slow-network hints.
- Heavier visuals (like the animated background) are treated as progressive enhancement.

## Why MDX

MDX lets us keep the workflow simple:

- Posts live in the repo
- Markdown renders with good typography
- We can add components later if a post needs richer UI
