# Building QuackStack.net

QuackStack.net isn't just a portfolio site — it's a bit of a self-inflicted case study. When you build client projects all day, your own site tends to get postponed. By the time we actually committed to rebuilding it from scratch, we'd accumulated enough lessons from our projects to do it right the first time.

The mandate was crystal clear: **build something that looks premium, loads fast, and actually stays manageable as we grow.** Not just "fast by 2025 standards," but genuinely fast. And not through hidden performance tricks or JavaScript bundle gymnastics, but through honest design and pragmatic tech choices.

Credit where it belongs: as of this post, the first version of the new site was designed and built by Valentin Asenov.

## Why we rebuilt

The original site worked, but it was showing its age. We had outdated case studies, a stale blog setup, and—most importantly—we knew we could do better. More than that, we wanted to prove we could practice what we preach: ship something that performs, that's maintainable, and that respects the user's time and bandwidth.

When you're selling optimization and thoughtful engineering to clients, your own site has to demonstrate that. It's not vanity—it's credibility.

## The tech stack (and why)

We landed on a deliberately minimal stack:

- **Next.js (App Router)** — Static generation where possible, ISR for blog posts, streaming for interactive sections
- **TypeScript** — Catches mistakes at build time, not production time
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling keeps the CSS bundle predictable and scales well with components
- **MDX via Nextra** — Markdown for content writers, React components for when we need interactivity
- **Vercel Analytics** — Real user metrics so we're not flying blind on performance

What we *didn't* include tells you something: no JavaScript animation library, no state management beyond React Context, no headless CMS (we edit the MDX files directly). Three developers, limited time — we couldn't afford to overcomplicate things. Every dependency had to earn its place.

## Design constraints as features

Here's something unexpected: constraints improved the design.

We imposed strict rules on ourselves:

- **One typeface** (Inter, system fallback to -apple-system)
- **Limited color palette** (brand colors + neutrals)
- **No custom CSS** — everything comes from Tailwind + component composition
- **Minimal motion** — only when it adds clarity, not decoration

These constraints forced us to solve problems through layout, hierarchy, and whitespace instead of visual effects. The site feels cohesive because everything is built from the same primitives. Yes, it was harder to design this way at first. But it's *so* much easier to maintain and extend.

## Performance from the ground up

We didn't optimize after the fact. Performance was baked into every decision, and we tuned against the same targets we use on client work: fast LCP on 4G, stable layout (CLS near zero), snappy interactions, and a lean JS bundle.

How we got there:

- **Static generation** for marketing pages (HTML cached at CDN)
- **WebP images** with fallbacks, lazy-loaded below the fold
- **Font subsetting** — we only load the characters we use
- **Component-level code splitting** — heavy components load on demand
- **No third-party scripts** (no analytics, no fonts from CDNs)

The Game of Life animation in the background? It actually has a performance detector built in. If the browser is struggling (low FPS), it reduces the particle count automatically. Users see motion either way; they just don't get a slideshow.

## Real challenges

### The parallax background

We wanted visual polish, but we were terrified of the performance cost. The first iteration used a massive Canvas element that re-rendered on every scroll event. Garbage collection went haywire on mobile.

The solution: **use CSS transforms instead**. `transform: translateY()` is GPU-accelerated and doesn't trigger layout recalculations. We animate it via JavaScript, but the browser's compositor handles the heavy lifting. Suddenly, 60fps became achievable even on mid-range phones.

### Mobile-first, but not second-class

The catch with "mobile-first design" is that it's easy to let desktop become an afterthought. We flipped it: design for mobile constraints, then enhance for larger screens.

This meant rethinking touch targets (48px minimum, not 44px), ensuring readability without pinch-zooming, and testing on actual devices—not just DevTools emulation. The toughest part? Resisting the urge to add "just one more feature" for desktop that would bloat the mobile experience.

### Staying disciplined

With three developers and no PM saying "no," scope creep is your worst enemy. We had a Figma file full of ideas: dark mode, animated charts, interactive project filters... all things we *could* build, but didn't need to.

The rule: ship the core first, measure real user requests, *then* consider adding things. We shipped, and exactly zero users asked for dark mode. Proof that your gut feeling about "essential features" is often wrong.

## What we learned

1. **Constraints create clarity.** Unlimited design choices lead to decision paralysis. Strict rules actually freed us to focus on what mattered.

2. **Performance doesn't require sacrifice.** People worry that a beautiful site has to be heavy. Ours proves otherwise—simplicity and speed are partners, not enemies.

3. **MDX is genuinely powerful.** Letting developers (and non-developers) write posts as markdown, then include components when needed, is surprisingly powerful. No CMS overhead, just files in the repo.

4. **Your own site is your best marketing.** Every performance metric, every accessibility feature, every thoughtful interaction—it's all selling your work better than any copy could.

## What's next

The site isn't "done" — it's never done. We're iterating on:

- More case studies (like this one!)
- Engineering deep-dives and technical posts
- Continued performance tuning as the site grows and gets more complex
- Exploring edge cases we haven't hit yet

But the foundation is solid, and that matters. We built something we're proud to show clients, and more importantly, something we actually enjoy maintaining. That's the real win.
