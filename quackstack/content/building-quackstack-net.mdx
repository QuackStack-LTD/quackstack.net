# Building QuackStack.net

QuackStack.net is our studio’s home base — a lightweight, fast marketing site that doubles as a portfolio and a blog.

The goal was simple:

- **Look premium** without being heavy
- **Load fast** on mobile and desktop
- **Stay maintainable** as we add more projects and write more posts

## The stack

We built the site with a pragmatic setup:

- **Next.js (App Router)** for routing and rendering
- **TypeScript** for safer refactors
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling
- **MDX (via Nextra)** so writing blog posts feels like writing markdown — with component power when needed

## Design system first

A marketing site lives and dies by consistency.

Instead of custom CSS for every section, we leaned on a small set of primitives (cards, badges, buttons) and repeated patterns:

- Strong typographic hierarchy
- Consistent spacing
- Reusable components for sections

## Motion — when it helps

Micro-interactions can make a site feel alive, but they also cost CPU/GPU (especially on mobile).

We treat motion as an enhancement:

- Effects reduce automatically when the user prefers reduced motion
- We avoid running expensive animations when they don’t add real value

## Content that scales

The blog is MDX-powered, which means:

- Posts are written in markdown
- Code blocks, headings, and links render cleanly
- We can include components in posts when we want richer content

## Navigation that tracks where you are

On a one-page layout, it’s easy to get lost.

We added a scroll-aware navbar that highlights the section you’re currently reading — it helps users understand the page structure and jump around quickly.

## What’s next

We’ll keep iterating on:

- More case studies
- More engineering articles
- Continued performance tuning as the site grows
