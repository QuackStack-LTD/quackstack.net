# Mastering Next.js 13 App Router: A Complete Guide

Next.js 13 introduced a revolutionary App Router that changes how we think about routing in React applications. This new approach brings improved developer experience, better performance, and more intuitive file-based routing.

## What's New in App Router?

The App Router introduces several key concepts:

1. **File-based routing**: Routes are defined by folder structure
2. **Layout system**: Shared UI components across routes
3. **Server Components**: Components that render on the server by default
4. **Streaming**: Progressive page loading for better UX

## Key Features

### Layouts

Layouts allow you to share UI between routes:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
	return (
		<html>
			<body>
				<nav>Navigation</nav>
				{children}
				<footer>Footer</footer>
			</body>
		</html>
	);
}
```

### Dynamic Routes

Create dynamic routes using square brackets:

```tsx
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
export default function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
	return <h1>Post: {params.slug}</h1>;
}
```

### Loading States

Create loading states with `loading.tsx`:

```tsx
// app/blog/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
	return <div>Loading posts...</div>;
}
```

## Migration Tips

Migrating from the Pages Router to App Router requires careful planning:

1. Start with new routes in the App Router
2. Gradually migrate existing pages
3. Update data fetching patterns
4. Test thoroughly

## Conclusion

The App Router represents the future of Next.js development. Its improved developer experience and performance benefits make it an excellent choice for new projects.
