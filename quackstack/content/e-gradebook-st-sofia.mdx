# Extending a Gradebook for Mobile

Private Primary School "St. Sofia" came to us with a clear need: their gradebook system — built internally by a teacher — worked well for desktop workflows. Teachers could reliably enter grades, and parents could access them from computers. But the mobile experience was limited. In our first conversation, the school's leadership noted that parents and teachers wanted better access on phones, and the navigation needed redesign for smaller screens.

The challenge was straightforward: enhance the interface for mobile and improve the UX without disrupting the backend that was already working well.

## The Challenge

The constraints were clear. The backend served the school well and held years of data and complex workflows. A full rewrite wasn't practical — it would risk data integrity, take too long, and cost far more than the budget allowed. They needed:

- A **mobile-first experience** layered on existing infrastructure
- **Zero-downtime deployment** of the new interface alongside the current system
- **Preserved authentication** and data flows
- A solution delivered in **8 weeks** (before the next grading period)

We had about 8 weeks. No room for mistakes.

## The Initial Audit

Before we committed to anything, we spent three days actually *using* the system like parents and teachers would. We logged in from phones, tried to navigate to grades, attempted to look at attendance. We took notes on every friction point.

What we found:

- The layout was optimized for desktop screens — tables didn't adapt to smaller mobile viewports
- Navigation required horizontal scrolling on phones to access buttons
- Load times were noticeably slow on 4G connections

The teacher who built the original system had created something solid and functional. Our job was to extend that foundation with a mobile-first layer that matched how parents and teachers actually used the system today.

## Our Approach

We sketched out two paths: rebuild the backend, or strategically modernize the front-end. A full rewrite would take 16+ weeks and cost 3x more. So we chose the trickier but smarter option: keep everything that works, extend and enhance what needed improvement.

### 1. Responsive Reskin

We didn't touch the backend. Instead, we built a new responsive UI layer that talked to the existing ASP.NET API. The navigation was completely rethought:

- One tap to view grades (not four clicks)
- Smart sidebar that collapses on mobile
- Touch-friendly buttons sized for thumbs, not mice

The trick was making sure our new CSS didn't break the existing backend logic. We used semantic HTML and CSS Grid to build responsive layouts without rewriting the server-side rendering.

### 2. Role-Aware Views

Parents and teachers shouldn't see the same thing. We built two distinct interfaces:

- **Parents**: The most important info first — their kid's grades, plus a heads-up about missing assignments and upcoming tests. We put the messaging system front and center because that's how parents prefer to contact teachers.
- **Teachers**: A class roster view for quick attendance, inline grade entry for faster updates, and a separate admin panel for more complex tasks.

A parent's workflow changed from "log in → navigate to child → find grade" to "log in → see grade." Two fewer clicks.

### 3. Performance Optimization

The existing system, like many web applications, could benefit from optimization. The original implementation included:

- Unminified assets (common for internal tools)
- Separate CSS and JS files without bundling
- Unoptimized images

We optimized aggressively. We minified and bundled assets, converted images to WebP, implemented HTTP caching. We also added service worker support for repeat visitors. First-page load time improved from ~4.2 seconds on 4G to about 1.1 seconds.

### 4. Authentication Preserved

The login system was actually solid. Instead of messing with it, we built around it. We preserved the session management, the password hashing, the audit logs — everything. This meant we didn't introduce any security regressions.

## The Real Challenges

Of course, nothing goes perfectly.

**Challenge 1: Legacy Data Quirks**

The old system had some... interesting data. We found grades entered with extra spaces, weird character encoding in names, and a few orphaned records. Before we launched, we had to write migration scripts to clean it all up. That took longer than we expected.

**Challenge 2: Browser Compatibility**

ASP.NET Web Forms sometimes generated HTML that older browsers loved but modern mobile browsers choked on. We had to add polyfills and work around some quirky form behavior. A few sessions we spent just figuring out why iOS Safari wouldn't submit grades properly.

**Challenge 3: School Integration**

St. Sofia runs multiple programs — kindergarten, primary school, even a small music academy. They share the same gradebook database. We had to ensure our new UI worked across all programs without breaking anything. Testing was intense.

## Results

We launched on time, mid-semester, with zero downtime. Here's what actually happened:

- **Parents started checking grades more often** — usage went up 60% in the first month (we tracked this through Google Analytics)
- **Teachers reported checking attendance from their phones** — previously they'd only do it from the office
- **No backend issues** — the ASP.NET layer kept chugging along, handling all our requests perfectly
- **Faster perceived experience** — especially for parents with slower connections in suburban areas
- **Editorial team managing everything** — the school's admin staff needed zero help after launch

One parent even sent a thank-you email. That was nice.

## What Actually Took Time

The biggest time investment wasn't the UI code. It was:

1. **Understanding the existing system** — mapping out the backend logic and data flows
2. **Testing edge cases** — every possible workflow across all user roles
3. **Coordinating with the school's staff** — ensuring deployment wouldn't disrupt existing systems

The actual UI development was about 2 weeks for two developers. The hard part was careful integration and comprehensive testing to preserve reliability.

## Lessons Learned

- **Enhancement over replacement.** When a system is already trusted and reliable, thoughtful modernization of the UI can deliver value faster and with lower risk than a rebuild.
- **Preserve what works.** The authentication, data layer, and business logic were solid. We focused on improving the experience layer.
- **Comprehensive testing is critical.** When integrating a new interface with an existing backend, testing everything is non-negotiable.
- **Design for actual workflows.** We didn't ask teachers or parents to change how they work. We adapted the interface to fit their needs.
- **Measure outcomes.** Usage, performance metrics, and user feedback tell you what actually matters.
