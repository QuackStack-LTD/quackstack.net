# Web Accessibility: Building Inclusive Digital Experiences

Web accessibility ensures that websites and applications are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. This guide covers essential accessibility principles and practical implementation strategies.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility is not just about compliance—it's about creating inclusive experiences that benefit everyone:

- **Legal requirements**: Many countries have accessibility laws
- **Broader audience**: Reach more users
- **Better UX**: Accessible design often improves usability for everyone
- **SEO benefits**: Many accessibility practices improve search rankings

## WCAG Guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a foundation for accessibility:

### Perceivable

- Provide text alternatives for images
- Offer captions for videos
- Ensure sufficient color contrast

### Operable

- Make all functionality keyboard accessible
- Give users enough time to read content
- Avoid content that causes seizures

### Understandable

- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate predictably
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### Robust

- Maximize compatibility with assistive technologies

## Practical Implementation

### Semantic HTML

```html
<main>
	<h1>Page Title</h1>
	<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
		<ul>
			<li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
			<li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
		</ul>
	</nav>
	<article>
		<h2>Article Title</h2>
		<p>Article content...</p>
	</article>
</main>
```

### ARIA Labels

```html
<button aria-label="Close dialog" onclick="closeDialog()">×</button>

<input type="search" aria-label="Search products" aria-describedby="search-help" />
<div id="search-help">Enter keywords to search our catalog</div>
```

### Focus Management

```css
/* Visible focus indicators */
:focus {
	outline: 2px solid #005fcc;
	outline-offset: 2px;
}

/* Skip to main content link */
.skip-link {
	position: absolute;
	left: -9999px;
}

.skip-link:focus {
	left: 6px;
	top: 7px;
	z-index: 999999;
}
```

## Testing Your Accessibility

1. **Keyboard navigation**: Tab through your entire interface
2. **Screen readers**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
3. **Automated tools**: Use axe-core, Lighthouse, or WAVE
4. **Color contrast**: Ensure ratios meet WCAG standards

## Conclusion

Building accessible web experiences is an ongoing process that requires consideration from the design phase through implementation and testing. By following these guidelines, you'll create more inclusive digital experiences for all users.
